# API assignment Read1

1. APIs are divided into four categories:

1. Open APIs: Access to these sorts of APIs, often known as Public APIs, is unrestricted because they are open to the public.

2. Partner APIs: Because this sort of API is not available to the general public, a developer must have particular permissions or licenses in order to utilize it.

3. Internal APIs: Only internal systems expose this sort of API, which is also known as Private APIs. These are generally created for a company's internal usage. This sort of API is used by the company's many internal teams to develop its goods and services.

4. Composite APIs: This API mixes data and service APIs in one package. It's a set of tasks that execute in a synchronous manner as a result of their execution rather than at the request of a job. Its primary functions are to increase the performance of listeners in web interfaces and to speed up the execution process.

## Web service APIs

There are other web service APIs in addition to the core web APIs:

- SOAP
- XML-RPC
- JSON-RPC
- REST

## Some Benefits from APIs

1. **Increases productivity.**

As the need for contemporary software grows, businesses are searching for faster ways to prototype and develop new products. Developers wasting time creating apps from the ground up when a similar solution is already available as an API might have a detrimental impact on your company's productivity.\
APIs are a great tool for accelerating development. Instead of building solutions from the ground up, developers may use APIs to swiftly incorporate existing functionality.

2. **Saves costs.**

The opportunity to save money is one of the most significant advantages of APIs for organizations. Using APIs to construct apps is a fantastic method to cut expenses because they dramatically reduce development work.\
Using APIs allows developers to focus on fine-tuning the unique features of their apps faster, which helps businesses save time and money.

3. **Enhances customer experience.**

Developers may use APIs to design solutions that satisfy specific consumer requirements, which would be impossible to do otherwise.\
Many companies, for example, utilize APIs to implement cutting-edge artificial intelligence and predictive analytics technology that analyzes a buyer's unique path and suggests the "next best action." This enhances the shopping experience for customers and increases sales.

4. **Collects data for intelligence analytics.**

APIs may provide a simple and rapid method for businesses to extract value from data if they are used seriously. You can track and evaluate how third-party developers use APIs by developing them and releasing them to the public. This gives you valuable information on how customers engage with your items.\
You may better understand your target market, discover weak areas in your business' processes, and improve your core products with acquired information analytics.

## differences between API and SDK

### What is an API?

Application programming interface (API) is a term that refers to a set of tools that An API allows communication between two platforms, whether it is used as a standalone solution or as part of an SDK.

### How an API works

APIs provide for seamless and efficient application integration.

Here's what an API request includes from a technical standpoint:

1. You begin the task from your app, making a request, as the app user who needs to perform a task.

2. The API sends a request to the web server, which is relayed via the API. Because the request is directed to the API endpoint, which is generally a server's URL, the API knows where to deliver it.

3. The task is subsequently completed by the service provider's third-party application or database.

### API use cases

- APIs of map

- APIs of weather

- APIs of payment

### Some of the API benefits

- Increases productivity
- Saves costs
- Enhances customer experience
- Collects data for intelligence analytics

### What is an SDK?

The term SDK refers to a software development kit. The SDK, sometimes known as a devkit, is a collection of software development tools for a certain platform, comprising building blocks, debuggers, and, in some cases, a framework or group of code libraries, such as a set of operating system-specific functions (OS).

### How an SDK works

SDKs are a set of tools that allow software developers to create software applications more quickly and uniformly.

An SDK's ease of use is equally as important as the tools it contains. The following is how it works:

1. Purchase, download, and install your platform's "kit" (e.g., premade parts, examples and instructions).

2. Start with the integrated development environment and open any APIs and development tools you need to construct a new application (IDE). This is where you will conduct your actual code and where your compiler will be located.

3. To build, follow the directions, documentation, code examples, and testing tools, which will give you and your team a leg up.

### SDK use cases

1. Programming language-specific SDKs Like JSON and JDK

2. Google and other analytics SDKs give information on user habits, routes, and activities.

3. Google, Facebook, and other monetization SDKs make it simple for developers to integrate ads into their current apps in order to generate income.

### Some of the SDK benefits

- Cost control
- Faster and smoother integrations
- Built-in support and expertise
- Software development requires access to component components and instructions
